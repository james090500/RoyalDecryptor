# ♟️ RoyalDecryptor
This is a safe decryptor for Royal Ransomware (.royal_w) files. 
**Note: This software is useless without the 4096 RSA Private Key from Royal**
So what's the point of this? If for some reason you get the RSA Key and need to decrypt, at least you know this is a safe way of doing so.
